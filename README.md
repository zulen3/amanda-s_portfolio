Exemplo:
 This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

 * Data was taken from the movielens dataset
 * The model uses both: content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
 * Algorithms Used: K-Nearest Neighbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatinins least Square (ALS)
 * Optimised the SVD & ALS model.
 * The Project write-up is published on [SSRN] (https:// link com o projeto publicado.com)
